# Topic 1. Kubernetes Namespace
Namespace is used to organized resources (like applications, services, and pods) so that they can coexist without interfering with each other. This is useful in the environment where many users and teams share the same Kubernetes cluster. 

Analogy: In the shared workspace. Each team own their own floor. Share workspace represent the cluster. Each floor is a namespace. Staff from one floor don't have access to the other. 

## 1️⃣ RBAC
Role-based access control.  Who can access what in the cluster. 

Difference between RBAC and IAM.
