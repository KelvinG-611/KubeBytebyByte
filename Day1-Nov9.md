## Topic 1. Virtualization vs. Minikube

**Minikube** utilizes **virtualization** to run a lightweight Kubernetes cluster on a local machine, simulating a full-fledged Kubernetes environment within a single virtual machine.

Q1: What is virtualization technology?

Imagine you have a spacious open-plan apartment with no separate rooms. This room is where you do all your activities - work, play, and rest. Now, suppose you want to have separate dedicated spaces for certain activities, like an office for working or a playroom for games. However, you can't afford to buy a new apartment. The best way to achieve this is by hiring a contractor to partition off new rooms.

In the tech world, the spacious apartment represents your computer, more specifically your operating system, such as MacOS or Windows. Your daily activities - work, play, and rest - are the programs running on your computer. The contractor that knows how to separate rooms is called virtualization technology. The new rooms, like the work office and playroom, are referred to as virtual machines.

So if you're using virtualization:

- Your one computer can pretend to be many computers.
- Each "pretend" computer can run a different operating system, like Windows in one and Linux in another.
- You can run different programs or tasks in these separate systems without them affecting each other. For example, developers use virtualization to test software on different operating systems without needing several separate physical computers. Or, you can use it to run a program that only works on Windows while you're using a Mac, by running a virtual Windows computer on your Mac.

Q2: What is Minikube? Why do we use minikube?
